# CLStudentTracker

Steps to run:

- Open Visual Studio solution

- Run in browser

Notes:

- This is more of a proof-of-concept for a more fleshed out idea I'm going to create when I have a little more time. This verison fulfills the CL requirements

- If it doesn't run try deleting the items out of App_Data to clear the database and run it again (you will then have to create at least one student). For some reason listing these files in a gitignore did not work, and I've tried it on computers where it ran fine with the existing files. ðŸ™ƒ
