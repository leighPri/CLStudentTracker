# CLStudentTracker

Steps to run:

- Open Visual Studio solution

- Run in browser

- You will have to create at least one student

Notes:

- This is more of a proof-of-concept for a more fleshed out idea I'm going to create when I have a little more time. This verison fulfills the CL requirements but I can do better 

- Project is set to drop the database and recreate it on every load. If you stop and relaunch the app, it's not bugged, it's working as intended
